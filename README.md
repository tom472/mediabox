# Prerequisites

  * [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
  * [VPN account from Private internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/Stevie) (Please see [binhex's Github Repo](https://github.com/binhex/arch-delugevpn) if you want to use a different VPN)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
  * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  
**PLEASE NOTE**

For simplicity's sake (eg. automatic dependency management), the method used to install these packages is Ubuntu 16.04's default package manager, [APT](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt).  There are several other methods that work just as well, if not better (especially if you don't have superuser access on your system), so use whichever method you prefer.  Continue when you've successfully installed all packages listed.

### Preinstall:

(You'll need superuser access to run these commands successfully)

Login with too and create a user to run docker

`# adduser plex`

Set a password to the user. Then give the new user sudo privileges

`# usermod -aG sudo plex`

Now logout from root account and login as plex user

`# exit`




### Installation:

(You'll need superuser access to run these commands successfully)

Start by updating and upgrading our current packages:

`$ sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`

Install the prerequisite packages:

`$ sudo apt install git python bridge-utils`

**Note** - Mediabox will install Docker CE as the default Docker version - if you skip this and run with older Docker versions you may have issues.

1. Uninstall old versions: `$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io`
Itâ€™s OK if apt-get reports that none of these packages are installed.
2. Install Docker CE: `$ sudo curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh`
3. Install Docker-Compose: 
<pre><code>$ sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.16.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` &gt; /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
</code></pre>
4. Set the permissions: `$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose`
5. Verify the installation: `$ docker-compose -v`

Add the current user to the docker group:

`$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

Adjustment for the the DelugeVPN container

`$ sudo /sbin/modprobe iptable_mangle`

Reboot your machine manually, or using the command line:

`$ sudo reboot`

# Using mediabox

Once the prerequisites are all taken care of you can move forward with using mediabox.

1. Clone the mediabox repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/tom472/mediabox.git`
2. Change directory into mediabox: `$ cd mediabox/`
3. Make the mediabox.sh script executable: `$ chmod +x mediabox.sh`
4. Run the mediabox.sh script: `$ ./mediabox.sh`  **Read below for the script questions**

**Please be prepared to supply the following details after you run Step 4 above.**

As the script runs you will be prompted for:

1. Your Private Internet Access credentials
    * **username**
    * **password**

2. The version of Plex you want to run
    * **latest**
    * **public**
    * **plexpass**
    
Note: If you choose plexpass as your version you may optionally specify CLAIM_TOKEN - you can get your claim token by logging in at [plex.tv/claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim)

3. The "style" of Portainer to use
    *  **auth** (will require a password, require a persistent volume map, and will need you to select the endpoint to manage)
    *  **noauth** (will not require a password for access and will automatically connect to the local Docker sock endpoint)
    
4. Credentials for the Deluge daemon (this is needed for the CouchPotato container)
    * **username**
    * **password**

Upon completion, the script will launch your mediabox containers.

##### **mediabox** has been tested to work on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS - Server and Desktop
